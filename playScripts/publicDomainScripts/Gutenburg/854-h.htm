<h2>FIRST ACT</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">SCENE</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Lawn in front of the terrace at
Hunstanton</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Sir John</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Lady Caroline Pontefract</span>, <span
class="smcap">Miss Worsley</span>, <i>on chairs under large yew
tree</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I believe this
is the first English country house you have stayed at, Miss
Worsley?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Lady
Caroline.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; You have no
country houses, I am told, in America?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; We have not many.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Have you any
country?&nbsp; What we should call country?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Smiling</i>.]&nbsp; We have the largest country in the world,
Lady Caroline.&nbsp; They used to tell us at school that some of
our states are as big as France and England put together.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Ah! you must
find it very draughty, I should fancy.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Sir John</span>.]&nbsp; John, you should have your
muffler.&nbsp; What is the use of my always knitting mufflers for
you if you won&rsquo;t wear them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.&nbsp; I am quite warm,
Caroline, I assure you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I think not,
John.&nbsp; Well, you couldn&rsquo;t come to a more charming
place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is
sometimes a little lax about the people she asks down here.&nbsp;
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.]&nbsp; Jane mixes
too much.&nbsp; Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
distinction.&nbsp; It is a privilege to meet him.&nbsp; And that
member of Parliament, Mr. Kettle&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.&nbsp; Kelvil, my love,
Kelvil.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; He must be
quite respectable.&nbsp; One has never heard his name before in
the whole course of one&rsquo;s life, which speaks volumes for a
man, nowadays.&nbsp; But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable
person.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; I dislike Mrs.
Allonby.&nbsp; I dislike her more than I can say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I am not sure,
Miss Worsley, that foreigners like yourself should cultivate
likes or dislikes about the people they are invited to
meet.&nbsp; Mrs. Allonby is very well born.&nbsp; She is a niece
of Lord Brancaster&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is said, of course, that she
ran away twice before she was married.&nbsp; But you know how
unfair people often are.&nbsp; I myself don&rsquo;t believe she
ran away more than once.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Arbuthnot is very
charming.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Ah, yes! the
young man who has a post in a bank.&nbsp; Lady Hunstanton is most
kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to have taken
quite a fancy to him.&nbsp; I am not sure, however, that Jane is
right in taking him out of his position.&nbsp; In my young days,
Miss Worsley, one never met any one in society who worked for
their living.&nbsp; It was not considered the thing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; In America those are
the people we respect most.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I have no
doubt of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Arbuthnot has a
beautiful nature!&nbsp; He is so simple, so sincere.&nbsp; He has
one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come across.&nbsp;
It is a privilege to meet <i>him</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; It is not
customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young lady to speak
with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.&nbsp;
English women conceal their feelings till after they are
married.&nbsp; They show them then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Do you, in England,
allow no friendship to exist between a young man and a young
girl?</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>,
<i>followed by Footman with shawls and a cushion</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; We think it
very inadvisable.&nbsp; Jane, I was just saying what a pleasant
party you have asked us to meet.&nbsp; You have a wonderful power
of selection.&nbsp; It is quite a gift.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Dear
Caroline, how kind of you!&nbsp; I think we all do fit in very
nicely together.&nbsp; And I hope our charming American visitor
will carry back pleasant recollections of our English country
life.&nbsp; [<i>To Footman</i>.]&nbsp; The cushion, there,
Francis.&nbsp; And my shawl.&nbsp; The Shetland.&nbsp; Get the
Shetland.&nbsp; [<i>Exit Footman for shawl</i>.]</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald
Arbuthnot</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Lady Hunstanton, I
have such good news to tell you.&nbsp; Lord Illingworth has just
offered to make me his secretary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; His
secretary?&nbsp; That is good news indeed, Gerald.&nbsp; It means
a very brilliant future in store for you.&nbsp; Your dear mother
will be delighted.&nbsp; I really must try and induce her to come
up here to-night.&nbsp; Do you think she would, Gerald?&nbsp; I
know how difficult it is to get her to go anywhere.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I am sure
she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord Illingworth had made
me such an offer.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter Footman with shawl</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I will write
and tell her about it, and ask her to come up and meet him.&nbsp;
[<i>To Footman</i>.]&nbsp; Just wait, Francis.&nbsp; [<i>Writes
letter</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; That is a very
wonderful opening for so young a man as you are, Mr.
Arbuthnot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; It is indeed, Lady
Caroline.&nbsp; I trust I shall be able to show myself worthy of
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I trust
so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Hester</span>.]&nbsp; <i>You</i> have not
congratulated me yet, Miss Worsley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Are you very pleased
about it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Of course I am.&nbsp;
It means everything to me&mdash;things that were out of the reach
of hope before may be within hope&rsquo;s reach now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Nothing should be out
of the reach of hope.&nbsp; Life is a hope.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I fancy,
Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord Illingworth is aiming
at.&nbsp; I heard that he was offered Vienna.&nbsp; But that may
not be true.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think that England should be represented abroad by an unmarried
man, Jane.&nbsp; It might lead to complications.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; You are too
nervous, Caroline.&nbsp; Believe me, you are too nervous.&nbsp;
Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.&nbsp; I was in hopes
he would have married lady Kelso.&nbsp; But I believe he said her
family was too large.&nbsp; Or was it her feet?&nbsp; I forget
which.&nbsp; I regret it very much.&nbsp; She was made to be an
ambassador&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; She certainly
has a wonderful faculty of remembering people&rsquo;s names, and
forgetting their faces.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Well, that
is very natural, Caroline, is it not?&nbsp; [<i>To
Footman</i>.]&nbsp; Tell Henry to wait for an answer.&nbsp; I
have written a line to your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your
good news, and to say she really must come to dinner.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit Footman</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; That is awfully kind
of you, Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Hester</span>.]&nbsp; Will you come for a stroll,
Miss Worsley?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; With pleasure.&nbsp;
[<i>Exit with</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I am very
much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot&rsquo;s good fortune.&nbsp; He
is quite a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of mine.&nbsp; And I am
particularly pleased that Lord Illingworth should have made the
offer of his own accord without my suggesting anything.&nbsp;
Nobody likes to be asked favours.&nbsp; I remember poor Charlotte
Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season, because she had
a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I saw the
governess, Jane.&nbsp; Lady Pagden sent her to me.&nbsp; It was
before Eleanor came out.&nbsp; She was far too good-looking to be
in any respectable household.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wonder Lady
Pagden was so anxious to get rid of her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that
explains it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; John, the
grass is too damp for you.&nbsp; You had better go and put on
your overshoes at once.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.&nbsp; I am quite
comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; You must allow
me to be the best judge of that, John.&nbsp; Pray do as I tell
you.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Sir John</span> <i>gets up and goes
off</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; You spoil
him, Caroline, you do indeed!</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.]</p>
<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.]&nbsp;
Well, dear, I hope you like the park.&nbsp; It is said to be well
timbered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; The trees are
wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Quite, quite
wonderful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; But somehow, I
feel sure that if I lived in the country for six months, I should
become so unsophisticated that no one would take the slightest
notice of me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I assure
you, dear, that the country has not that effect at all.&nbsp;
Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from here,
that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.&nbsp; I remember
the occurrence perfectly.&nbsp; Poor Lord Belton died three days
afterwards of joy, or gout.&nbsp; I forget which.&nbsp; We had a
large party staying here at the time, so we were all very much
interested in the whole affair.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I think to
elope is cowardly.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s running away from
danger.&nbsp; And danger has become so rare in modern life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; As far as I
can make out, the young women of the present day seem to make it
the sole object of their lives to be always playing with
fire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; The one
advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is that one never
gets even singed.&nbsp; It is the people who don&rsquo;t know how
to play with it who get burned up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Yes; I see
that.&nbsp; It is very, very helpful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how the world would get on with such a theory as
that, dear Mrs. Allonby.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; The
world was made for men and not for women.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t
say that, Lady Stutfield.&nbsp; We have a much better time than
they have.&nbsp; There are far more things forbidden to us than
are forbidden to them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Yes; that is
quite, quite true.&nbsp; I had not thought of that.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Kelvil</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Well, Mr.
Kelvil, have you got through your work?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; I have finished my
writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; It has been an
arduous task.&nbsp; The demands on the time of a public man are
very heavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t
think they meet with adequate recognition.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; John, have you
got your overshoes on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.&nbsp; Yes, my love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I think you
had better come over here, John.&nbsp; It is more sheltered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.&nbsp; I am quite
comfortable, Caroline.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I think not,
John.&nbsp; You had better sit beside me.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Sir John</span> <i>rises and goes across</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; And what have
you been writing about this morning, Mr. Kelvil?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; On the usual subject,
Lady Stutfield.&nbsp; On Purity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; That must be
such a very, very interesting thing to write about.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; It is the one subject
of really national importance, nowadays, Lady Stutfield.&nbsp; I
purpose addressing my constituents on the question before
Parliament meets.&nbsp; I find that the poorer classes of this
country display a marked desire for a higher ethical
standard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; How quite,
quite nice of them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Are you in
favour of women taking part in politics, Mr. Kettle?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.&nbsp; Kelvil, my love,
Kelvil.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; The growing influence
of women is the one reassuring thing in our political life, Lady
Caroline.&nbsp; Women are always on the side of morality, public
and private.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; It is so
very, very gratifying to hear you say that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah,
yes!&mdash;the moral qualities in women&mdash;that is the
important thing.&nbsp; I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord
Illingworth doesn&rsquo;t value the moral qualities in women as
much as he should.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord
Illingworth</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; The world
says that Lord Illingworth is very, very wicked.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; But what
world says that, Lady Stutfield?&nbsp; It must be the next
world.&nbsp; This world and I are on excellent terms.&nbsp;
[<i>Sits down beside</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Allonby</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Every one
<i>I</i> know says you are very, very wicked.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; It is
perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying
things against one behind one&rsquo;s back that are absolutely
and entirely true.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Dear Lord
Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady Stutfield.&nbsp; I have given
up trying to reform him.&nbsp; It would take a Public Company
with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.&nbsp;
But you have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth,
haven&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Gerald Arbuthnot has told us of his good
fortune; it is really most kind of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Oh,
don&rsquo;t say that, Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; Kind is a dreadful
word.&nbsp; I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I
met him, and he&rsquo;ll be of considerable use to me in
something I am foolish enough to think of doing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; He is an
admirable young man.&nbsp; And his mother is one of my dearest
friends.&nbsp; He has just gone for a walk with our pretty
American.&nbsp; She is very pretty, is she not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Far too
pretty.&nbsp; These American girls carry off all the good
matches.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t they stay in their own
country?&nbsp; They are always telling us it is the Paradise of
women.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; It is, Lady
Caroline.&nbsp; That is why, like Eve, they are so extremely
anxious to get out of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Who are Miss
Worsley&rsquo;s parents?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; American
women are wonderfully clever in concealing their parents.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear Lord
Illingworth, what do you mean?&nbsp; Miss Worsley, Caroline, is
an orphan.&nbsp; Her father was a very wealthy millionaire or
philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son quite
hospitably, when he visited Boston.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how
he made his money, originally.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; I fancy in American
dry goods.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; What are
American dry goods?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; American
novels.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; How very
singular! . . . Well, from whatever source her large fortune
came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.&nbsp; She dresses
exceedingly well.&nbsp; All Americans do dress well.&nbsp; They
get their clothes in Paris.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; They say, Lady
Hunstanton, that when good Americans die they go to Paris.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp;
Indeed?&nbsp; And when bad Americans die, where do they go
to?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Oh, they go
to America.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; I am afraid you
don&rsquo;t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; It is a
very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; The youth
of America is their oldest tradition.&nbsp; It has been going on
now for three hundred years.&nbsp; To hear them talk one would
imagine they were in their first childhood.&nbsp; As far as
civilisation goes they are in their second.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; There is undoubtedly
a great deal of corruption in American politics.&nbsp; I suppose
you allude to that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I
wonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Politics are
in a sad way everywhere, I am told.&nbsp; They certainly are in
England.&nbsp; Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.&nbsp; I
wonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.&nbsp; I am sure, Lord Illingworth,
you don&rsquo;t think that uneducated people should be allowed to
have votes?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I think
they are the only people who should.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; Do you take no side
then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; One should
never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil.&nbsp; Taking sides is
the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows shortly
afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.&nbsp; However,
the House of Commons really does very little harm.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t make people good by Act of Parliament,&mdash;that is
something.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; You cannot deny that
the House of Commons has always shown great sympathy with the
sufferings of the poor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; That is its
special vice.&nbsp; That is the special vice of the age.&nbsp;
One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of
life.&nbsp; The less said about life&rsquo;s sores the better,
Mr. Kelvil.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; Still our East End is
a very important problem.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Quite
so.&nbsp; It is the problem of slavery.&nbsp; And we are trying
to solve it by amusing the slaves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Certainly, a
great deal may be done by means of cheap entertainments, as you
say, Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; Dear Dr. Daubeny, our rector here,
provides, with the assistance of his curates, really admirable
recreations for the poor during the winter.&nbsp; And much good
may be done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some
popular amusement of that kind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I am not at
all in favour of amusements for the poor, Jane.&nbsp; Blankets
and coals are sufficient.&nbsp; There is too much love of
pleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.&nbsp; Health is what
we want in modern life.&nbsp; The tone is not healthy, not
healthy at all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; You are quite right,
Lady Caroline.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I believe I am
usually right.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Horrid word
&lsquo;health.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Silliest
word in our language, and one knows so well the popular idea of
health.&nbsp; The English country gentleman galloping after a
fox&mdash;the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; May I ask, Lord
Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as a better
institution than the House of Commons?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; A much
better institution, of course.&nbsp; We in the House of Lords are
never in touch with public opinion.&nbsp; That makes us a
civilised body.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; Are you serious in
putting forward such a view?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Quite
serious, Mr. Kelvil.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Allonby</span>.]&nbsp; Vulgar habit that is people have nowadays
of asking one, after one has given them an idea, whether one is
serious or not.&nbsp; Nothing is serious except passion.&nbsp;
The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has been.&nbsp;
It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.&nbsp; The
only serious form of intellect I know is the British
intellect.&nbsp; And on the British intellect the illiterates
play the drum.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; What are you
saying, Lord Illingworth, about the drum?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I was
merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the leading articles in the
London newspapers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; But do you
believe all that is written in the newspapers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp;
Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs.&nbsp; [<i>Rises
with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Are you
going, Mrs. Allonby?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Just as far as
the conservatory.&nbsp; Lord Illingworth told me this morning
that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven deadly
sins.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear, I
hope there is nothing of the kind.&nbsp; I will certainly speak
to the gardener.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Remarkable
type, Mrs. Allonby.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; She lets her
clever tongue run away with her sometimes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Is that the
only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to run away with her?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I hope so,
Caroline, I am sure.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Alfred</span>.]</p>
<p>Dear Lord Alfred, do join us.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Lord
Alfred</span> <i>sits down beside</i> <span class="smcap">Lady
Stutfield</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; You believe
good of every one, Jane.&nbsp; It is a great fault.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Do you
really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one should believe evil
of every one?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I think it is
much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.&nbsp; Until, of course,
people are found out to be good.&nbsp; But that requires a great
deal of investigation nowadays.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; But there is
so much unkind scandal in modern life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Lord
Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that the basis of
every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; Lord Illingworth is,
of course, a very brilliant man, but he seems to me to be lacking
in that fine faith in the nobility and purity of life which is so
important in this century.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Yes, quite,
quite important, is it not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; He gives me the
impression of a man who does not appreciate the beauty of our
English home-life.&nbsp; I would say that he was tainted with
foreign ideas on the subject.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; There is
nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life, is there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; It is the mainstay of
our moral system in England, Lady Stutfield.&nbsp; Without it we
would become like our neighbours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; That would be
so, so sad, would it not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; I am afraid, too,
that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as a toy.&nbsp; Now, I
have never regarded woman as a toy.&nbsp; Woman is the
intellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.&nbsp;
Without her we should forget the true ideals.&nbsp; [<i>Sits down

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; I am so very,

charming those gold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord
Alfred.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Alfred</span>.&nbsp; They are awfully
expensive.&nbsp; I can only afford them when I&rsquo;m in
debt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; It must be
terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Alfred</span>.&nbsp; One must have
some occupation nowadays.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t my debts I
shouldn&rsquo;t have anything to think about.&nbsp; All the chaps

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; But

very strange.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah, here is
a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.&nbsp; She
won&rsquo;t dine.&nbsp; I am so sorry.&nbsp; But she will come in

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking at

Femininity is the quality I admire most in women.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking
back letter and leaving it on table</i>.]&nbsp; Oh! she is very
feminine, Caroline, and so good too.&nbsp; You should hear what
the Archdeacon says of her.&nbsp; He regards her as his right
hand in the parish.&nbsp; [<i>Footman speaks to her</i>.]&nbsp;
In the Yellow Drawing-room.&nbsp; Shall we all go in?&nbsp; Lady
Stutfield, shall we go in to tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.&nbsp; Certainly, my
love.&nbsp; [<i>Exeunt</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Curious thing,
plain women are always jealous of their husbands, beautiful women
never are!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Beautiful
women never have time.&nbsp; They are always so occupied in being
jealous of other people&rsquo;s husbands.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I should have
thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired of conjugal anxiety
by this time!&nbsp; Sir John is her fourth!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; So much
marriage is certainly not becoming.&nbsp; Twenty years of romance
make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of marriage make
her something like a public building.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Twenty years of
romance!&nbsp; Is there such a thing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Not in our
day.&nbsp; Women have become too brilliant.&nbsp; Nothing spoils
a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Or the want of
it in the man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; You are
quite right.&nbsp; In a Temple every one should be serious,
except the thing that is worshipped.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; And that should
be man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Women kneel

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; You are
thinking of Lady Stutfield!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I assure
you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for the last quarter of
an hour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Is she such a
mystery?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; She is more

<p>Charming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; He is very
nice; very nice indeed.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t stand the
American young lady.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; She told me
yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too, that she was only
eighteen.&nbsp; It was most annoying.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; One should
never trust a woman who tells one her real age.&nbsp; A woman who
would tell one that, would tell one anything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; She is a
Puritan besides&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that is
inexcusable.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind plain women being
Puritans.&nbsp; It is the only excuse they have for being
plain.&nbsp; But she is decidedly pretty.&nbsp; I admire her
immensely.&nbsp; [<i>Looks steadfastly at</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; What a
thoroughly bad man you must be!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; What do you
call a bad man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; The sort of man
who admires innocence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; And a bad
woman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Oh! the sort of
woman a man never gets tired of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; You are
severe&mdash;on yourself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Define us as a

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Sphinxes
without secrets.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Does that
include the Puritan women?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Do you
know, I don&rsquo;t believe in the existence of Puritan
women?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think there is a woman in the world
who would not be a little flattered if one made love to
her.&nbsp; It is that which makes women so irresistibly
adorable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; You think there
is no woman in the world who would object to being kissed?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Very
few.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Miss Worsley
would not let you kiss her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Are you
sure?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Quite.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; What do you
think she&rsquo;d do if I kissed her?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Either marry
you, or strike you across the face with her glove.&nbsp; What
would you do if she struck you across the face with her
glove?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Fall in

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Then it is
lucky you are not going to kiss her!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Is that a
challenge?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; It is an arrow
shot into the air.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you know that I always succeed in whatever I try?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I am sorry to
hear it.&nbsp; We women adore failures.&nbsp; They lean on
us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; You worship
successes.&nbsp; You cling to them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; We are the
laurels to hide their baldness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; And they
need you always, except at the moment of triumph.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; They are
uninteresting then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; How
tantalising you are!&nbsp; [<i>A pause</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Lord
Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like you for.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Only one
thing?&nbsp; And I have so many bad qualities.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Ah, don&rsquo;t
be too conceited about them.&nbsp; You may lose them as you grow
old.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I never
intend to grow old.&nbsp; The soul is born old but grows
young.&nbsp; That is the comedy of life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; And the body is
born young and grows old.&nbsp; That is life&rsquo;s tragedy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Its comedy
also, sometimes.&nbsp; But what is the mysterious reason why you
will always like me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; It is that you
have never made love to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I have
never done anything else.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; I
have not noticed it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; How
fortunate!&nbsp; It might have been a tragedy for both of us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; We should each
have survived.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; One can
survive everything nowadays, except death, and live down anything
except a good reputation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Have you tried
a good reputation?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; It is one
of the many annoyances to which I have never been subjected.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; It may
come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Why do you
threaten me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I will tell you
when you have kissed the Puritan.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter Footman</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francis</span>.&nbsp; Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Shall we go

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Do you like
such simple pleasures?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I adore
simple pleasures.&nbsp; They are the last refuge of the
complex.&nbsp; But, if you wish, let us stay here.&nbsp; Yes, let
us stay here.&nbsp; The Book of Life begins with a man and a
woman in a garden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; It ends with

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; You fence
divinely.&nbsp; But the button has come of your foil.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I have still
the mask.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; It makes
your eyes lovelier.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Thank
you.&nbsp; Come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Who?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Oh! no
one.&nbsp; No one in particular.&nbsp; A woman of no

<h2>SECOND ACT</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">SCENE</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Drawing-room at Hunstanton</i>,
<i>after dinner</i>, <i>lamps lit</i>.&nbsp; <i>Door</i>
L.C.&nbsp; <i>Door</i> R.C.</p>
<p>[<i>Ladies seated on sofas</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; What a comfort
it is to have got rid of the men for a little!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Yes; men
persecute us dreadfully, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Persecute
us?&nbsp; I wish they did.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; The annoying
thing is that the wretches can be perfectly happy without
us.&nbsp; That is why I think it is every woman&rsquo;s duty
never to leave them alone for a single moment, except during this
short breathing space after dinner; without which I believe we
poor women would be absolutely worn to shadows.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter Servants with coffee</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Worn to
shadows, dear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Lady
Hunstanton.&nbsp; It is such a strain keeping men up to the
mark.&nbsp; They are always trying to escape from us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; It seems to
me that it is we who are always trying to escape from them.&nbsp;
Men are so very, very heartless.&nbsp; They know their power and
use it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Takes
coffee from Servant</i>.]&nbsp; What stuff and nonsense all this
about men is!&nbsp; The thing to do is to keep men in their
proper place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; But what is
their proper place, Lady Caroline?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Looking after
their wives, Mrs. Allonby.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Takes
coffee from Servant</i>.]&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; And if
they&rsquo;re not married?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; If they are
not married, they should be looking after a wife.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are
going about society.&nbsp; There should be a law passed to compel
them all to marry within twelve months.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Refuses
coffee</i>.]&nbsp; But if they&rsquo;re in love with some one
who, perhaps, is tied to another?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; In that case,
Lady Stutfield, they should be married off in a week to some
plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to meddle with
other people&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think that we should ever be spoken of as other people&rsquo;s
property.&nbsp; All men are married women&rsquo;s property.&nbsp;
That is the only true definition of what married women&rsquo;s
property really is.&nbsp; But we don&rsquo;t belong to any
one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Oh, I am so
very, very glad to hear you say so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; But do you
really think, dear Caroline, that legislation would improve
matters in any way?&nbsp; I am told that, nowadays, all the
married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like
married men.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I certainly
never know one from the other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Oh, I think
one can always know at once whether a man has home claims upon
his life or not.&nbsp; I have noticed a very, very sad expression
in the eyes of so many married men.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Ah, all that I
have noticed is that they are horribly tedious when they are good
husbands, and abominably conceited when they are not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Well, I
suppose the type of husband has completely changed since my young
days, but I&rsquo;m bound to state that poor dear Hunstanton was
the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Ah, my husband
is a sort of promissory note; I&rsquo;m tired of meeting him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; But you renew
him from time to time, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Oh no, Lady
Caroline.&nbsp; I have only had one husband as yet.&nbsp; I
suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; With your
views on life I wonder you married at all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; So do I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear
child, I believe you are really very happy in your married life,
but that you like to hide your happiness from others.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I assure you I
was horribly deceived in Ernest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Oh, I hope
not, dear.&nbsp; I knew his mother quite well.&nbsp; She was a
Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland&rsquo;s daughters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Victoria
Stratton?&nbsp; I remember her perfectly.&nbsp; A silly
fair-haired woman with no chin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Ah, Ernest has
a chin.&nbsp; He has a very strong chin, a square chin.&nbsp;
Ernest&rsquo;s chin is far too square.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; But do you
really think a man&rsquo;s chin can be too square?&nbsp; I think
a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be
quite, quite square.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Then you should
certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.&nbsp; It is only fair to
tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; I adore
silent men.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Oh, Ernest
isn&rsquo;t silent.&nbsp; He talks the whole time.&nbsp; But he
has got no conversation.&nbsp; What he talks about I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t listened to him for years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Have you
never forgiven him then?&nbsp; How sad that seems!&nbsp; But all
life is very, very sad, is it not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Life, Lady
Stutfield, is simply a <i>mauvais quart d&rsquo;heure</i> made up
of exquisite moments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Yes, there
are moments, certainly.&nbsp; But was it something very, very
wrong that Mr. Allonby did?&nbsp; Did he become angry with you,
and say anything that was unkind or true?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Oh dear,
no.&nbsp; Ernest is invariably calm.&nbsp; That is one of the
reasons he always gets on my nerves.&nbsp; Nothing is so
aggravating as calmness.&nbsp; There is something positively
brutal about the good temper of most modern men.&nbsp; I wonder
we women stand it as well as we do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Yes;
men&rsquo;s good temper shows they are not so sensitive as we
are, not so finely strung.&nbsp; It makes a great barrier often
between husband and wife, does it not?&nbsp; But I would so much
like to know what was the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Well, I will
tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell everybody else.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Thank you,
thank you.&nbsp; I will make a point of repeating it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; When Ernest and
I were engaged, he swore to me positively on his knees that he
had never loved any one before in the whole course of his
life.&nbsp; I was very young at the time, so I didn&rsquo;t
believe him, I needn&rsquo;t tell you.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
however, I made no enquiries of any kind till after I had been
actually married four or five months.&nbsp; I found out then that
what he had told me was perfectly true.&nbsp; And that sort of
thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Men always want
to be a woman&rsquo;s first love.&nbsp; That is their clumsy
vanity.&nbsp; We women have a more subtle instinct about
things.&nbsp; What we like is to be a man&rsquo;s last
romance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; I see what
you mean.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very, very beautiful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear
child, you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that you won&rsquo;t
forgive your husband because he never loved any one else?&nbsp;
Did you ever hear such a thing, Caroline?&nbsp; I am quite
surprised.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Oh, women have
become so highly educated, Jane, that nothing should surprise us
nowadays, except happy marriages.&nbsp; They apparently are
getting remarkably rare.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Oh,
they&rsquo;re quite out of date.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Except
amongst the middle classes, I have been told.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; How like the
middle classes!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;is
it not?&mdash;very, very like them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; If what you
tell us about the middle classes is true, Lady Stutfield, it
redounds greatly to their credit.&nbsp; It is much to be
regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so
persistently frivolous, under the impression apparently that it
is the proper thing to be.&nbsp; It is to that I attribute the
unhappiness of so many marriages we all know of in society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Do you know,
Lady Caroline, I don&rsquo;t think the frivolity of the wife has
ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined nowadays
by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.&nbsp;
How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on
treating her as if she were a perfectly rational being?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Man, poor,
awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a sex that has been
rational for millions and millions of years.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t
help himself.&nbsp; It is in his race.&nbsp; The History of Woman
is very different.&nbsp; We have always been picturesque protests
against the mere existence of common sense.&nbsp; We saw its
dangers from the first.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Yes, the
common sense of husbands is certainly most, most trying.&nbsp; Do
tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.&nbsp; I think it
would be so very, very helpful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; The Ideal
Husband?&nbsp; There couldn&rsquo;t be such a thing.&nbsp; The
institution is wrong.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; The Ideal
Man, then, in his relations to <i>us</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; He would
probably be extremely realistic.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Caroline</span>.&nbsp; The Ideal
Man!&nbsp; Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were
goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.&nbsp; He should
refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our
whims.&nbsp; He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid
us to have missions.&nbsp; He should always say much more than he
means, and always mean much more than he says.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; But how
could he do both, dear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; He should never
run down other pretty women.&nbsp; That would show he had no
taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.&nbsp; No; he
should be nice about them all, but say that somehow they
don&rsquo;t attract him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Yes, that is
always very, very pleasant to hear about other women.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; If we ask him a
question about anything, he should give us an answer all about
ourselves.&nbsp; He should invariably praise us for whatever
qualities he knows we haven&rsquo;t got.&nbsp; But he should be
pitiless, quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that
we have never dreamed of possessing.&nbsp; He should never
believe that we know the use of useful things.&nbsp; That would
be unforgiveable.&nbsp; But he should shower on us everything we
don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; As far as I
can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills and compliments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; He should
persistently compromise us in public, and treat us with absolute
respect when we are alone.&nbsp; And yet he should be always
ready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one,
and to become miserable, absolutely miserable, at a
moment&rsquo;s notice, and to overwhelm us with just reproaches
in less than twenty minutes, and to be positively violent at the
end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever at a quarter to
eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.&nbsp; And when,
after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has
refused to take back the little things he has given one, and
promised never to communicate with one again, or to write one any
foolish letters, he should be perfectly broken-hearted, and
telegraph to one all day long, and send one little notes every
half-hour by a private hansom, and dine quite alone at the club,
so that every one should know how unhappy he was.&nbsp; And after
a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about everywhere
with one&rsquo;s husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one
was, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and
then, if his conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has
behaved really badly to him, he should be allowed to admit that
he has been entirely in the wrong, and when he has admitted that,
it becomes a woman&rsquo;s duty to forgive, and one can do it all
over again from the beginning, with variations.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; How clever
you are, my dear!&nbsp; You never mean a single word you say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Thank you,
thank you.&nbsp; It has been quite, quite entrancing.&nbsp; I
must try and remember it all.&nbsp; There are such a number of
details that are so very, very important.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; But you have
not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal Man is to be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; His
reward?&nbsp; Oh, infinite expectation.&nbsp; That is quite
enough for him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; But men are
so terribly, terribly exacting, are they not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; That makes no
matter.&nbsp; One should never surrender.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Not even to
the Ideal Man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Certainly not
to him.&nbsp; Unless, of course, one wants to grow tired of
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Oh! . . .
yes.&nbsp; I see that.&nbsp; It is very, very helpful.&nbsp; Do
you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?&nbsp;
Or are there more than one?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; There are just
four in London, Lady Stutfield.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Oh, my
dear!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Going over
to her</i>.]&nbsp; What has happened?&nbsp; Do tell me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span> [<i>in a low
voice</i>]&nbsp; I had completely forgotten that the American
young lady has been in the room all the time.&nbsp; I am afraid
some of this clever talk may have shocked her a little.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that will
do her so much good!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Let us hope
she didn&rsquo;t understand much.&nbsp; I think I had better go
over and talk to her.&nbsp; [<i>Rises and goes across to</i>
<span class="smcap">Hester Worsley</span>.]&nbsp; Well, dear Miss
Worsley. [<i>Sitting down beside her</i>.]&nbsp; How quiet you
have been in your nice little corner all this time!&nbsp; I
suppose you have been reading a book?&nbsp; There are so many
books here in the library.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; No, I have been
listening to the conversation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t believe everything that was said, you know,
dear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
believe any of it</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; That is
quite right, dear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Continuing</i>.]&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t believe that any
women could really hold such views of life as I have heard
to-night from some of your guests.&nbsp; [<i>An awkward
pause</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I hear you
have such pleasant society in America.&nbsp; Quite like our own
in places, my son wrote to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; There are cliques in
America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; But true American
society consists simply of all the good women and good men we
have in our country.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; What a
sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant too.&nbsp; I am
afraid in England we have too many artificial social
barriers.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t see as much as we should of the
middle and lower classes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; In America we have no
lower classes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp;
Really?&nbsp; What a very strange arrangement!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; What is that
dreadful girl talking about?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; She is
painfully natural, is she not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; There are a
great many things you haven&rsquo;t got in America, I am told,
Miss Worsley.&nbsp; They say you have no ruins, and no
curiosities.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.]&nbsp; What
nonsense!&nbsp; They have their mothers and their manners.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; The English
aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady Caroline.&nbsp;
They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the
steamers, and propose to us the day after they land.&nbsp; As for
ruins, we are trying to build up something that will last longer
than brick or stone.&nbsp; [<i>Gets up to take her fan from
table</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; What is
that, dear?&nbsp; Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it not, at that
place that has the curious name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Standing by
table</i>.]&nbsp; We are trying to build up life, Lady
Hunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on
here.&nbsp; This sounds strange to you all, no doubt.&nbsp; How
could it sound other than strange?&nbsp; You rich people in
England, you don&rsquo;t know how you are living.&nbsp; How could
you know?&nbsp; You shut out from your society the gentle and the
good.&nbsp; You laugh at the simple and the pure.&nbsp; Living,
as you all do, on others and by them, you sneer at
self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread to the poor, it is merely
to keep them quiet for a season.&nbsp; With all your pomp and
wealth and art you don&rsquo;t know how to live&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t even know that.&nbsp; You love the beauty that you
can see and touch and handle, the beauty that you can destroy,
and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of life, of the unseen
beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.&nbsp; You have lost
life&rsquo;s secret.&nbsp; Oh, your English society seems to me
shallow, selfish, foolish.&nbsp; It has blinded its eyes, and
stopped its ears.&nbsp; It lies like a leper in purple.&nbsp; It
sits like a dead thing smeared with gold.&nbsp; It is all wrong,
all wrong.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think one should know of these things.&nbsp; It is not very, very
nice, is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear Miss
Worsley, I thought you liked English society so much.&nbsp; You
were such a success in it.&nbsp; And you were so much admired by
the best people.&nbsp; I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said
of you&mdash;but it was most complimentary, and you know what an
authority he is on beauty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Lord Henry
Weston!&nbsp; I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; A man with a
hideous smile and a hideous past.&nbsp; He is asked
everywhere.&nbsp; No dinner-party is complete without him.&nbsp;
What of those whose ruin is due to him?&nbsp; They are
outcasts.&nbsp; They are nameless.&nbsp; If you met them in the
street you would turn your head away.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
complain of their punishment.&nbsp; Let all women who have sinned
be punished.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span> <i>enters from
terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil over her
head</i>.&nbsp; <i>She hears the last words and starts</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear
young lady!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; It is right that they
should be punished, but don&rsquo;t let them be the only ones to
suffer.&nbsp; If a man and woman have sinned, let them both go
forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.&nbsp;
Let them both be branded.&nbsp; Set a mark, if you wish, on each,
but don&rsquo;t punish the one and let the other go free.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t have one law for men and another for women.&nbsp; You
are unjust to women in England.&nbsp; And till you count what is
a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be
unjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of
cloud, will be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or
if seen, not regarded.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Might I, dear
Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask you for my cotton that
is just behind you?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear Mrs.
Arbuthnot!&nbsp; I am so pleased you have come up.&nbsp; But I
didn&rsquo;t hear you announced.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Oh, I came
straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton, just as I
was.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t tell me you had a party.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Not a
party.&nbsp; Only a few guests who are staying in the house, and
whom you must know.&nbsp; Allow me.&nbsp; [<i>Tries to help
her</i>.&nbsp; <i>Rings bell</i>.]&nbsp; Caroline, this is Mrs.
Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends.&nbsp; Lady Caroline
Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young American
friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how wicked
we are.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; I am afraid you think
I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; But there are some
things in England&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear
young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I dare say, in what
you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it, which is
much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.&nbsp; The
only point where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady
Caroline&rsquo;s brother, about poor Lord Henry.&nbsp; He is
really such good company.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter Footman</i>.]</p>
<p>Take Mrs. Arbuthnot&rsquo;s things.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit Footman with wraps</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Lady Caroline, I had
no idea it was your brother.&nbsp; I am sorry for the pain I must
have caused you&mdash;I&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; My dear Miss
Worsley, the only part of your little speech, if I may so term
it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part about my
brother.&nbsp; Nothing that you could possibly say could be too
bad for him.&nbsp; I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely
infamous.&nbsp; But I am bound to state, as you were remarking,
Jane, that he is excellent company, and he has one of the best
cooks in London, and after a good dinner one can forgive anybody,
even one&rsquo;s own relations.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span> [<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Miss Worsley</span>]&nbsp; Now, do come, dear, and
make friends with Mrs. Arbuthnot.&nbsp; She is one of the good,
sweet, simple people you told us we never admitted into
society.&nbsp; I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot comes very rarely
to me.&nbsp; But that is not my fault.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; What a bore it
is the men staying so long after dinner!&nbsp; I expect they are
saying the most dreadful things about us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; Do you really
think so?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I was sure of
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; How very,
very horrid of them!&nbsp; Shall we go onto the terrace?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Oh, anything to
get away from the dowagers and the dowdies.&nbsp; [<i>Rises and
goes with</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span> <i>to
door</i> L.C.]&nbsp; We are only going to look at the stars, Lady
Hunstanton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; You will
find a great many, dear, a great many.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t
catch cold.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Arbuthnot</span>.]&nbsp; We shall all miss Gerald so much, dear
Mrs. Arbuthnot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; But has Lord
Illingworth really offered to make Gerald his secretary?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Oh,
yes!&nbsp; He has been most charming about it.&nbsp; He has the
highest possible opinion of your boy.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know
Lord Illingworth, I believe, dear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I have never
met him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; You know him
by name, no doubt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I am afraid I
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I live so much out of the world, and see so
few people.&nbsp; I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord
Illingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah,
yes.&nbsp; That would be the last Earl but one.&nbsp; He was a
very curious man.&nbsp; He wanted to marry beneath him.&nbsp; Or
wouldn&rsquo;t, I believe.&nbsp; There was some scandal about
it.&nbsp; The present Lord Illingworth is quite different.&nbsp;
He is very distinguished.&nbsp; He does&mdash;well, he does
nothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here
thinks very wrong of anybody, and I don&rsquo;t know that he
cares much for the subjects in which you are so interested, dear
Mrs. Arbuthnot.&nbsp; Do you think, Caroline, that Lord
Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I should fancy
not at all, Jane.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; We all have
our different tastes, have we not?&nbsp; But Lord Illingworth has
a very high position, and there is nothing he couldn&rsquo;t get
if he chose to ask for it.&nbsp; Of course, he is comparatively a
young man still, and he has only come to his title
within&mdash;how long exactly is it, Caroline, since Lord
Illingworth succeeded?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; About four
years, I think, Jane.&nbsp; I know it was the same year in which
my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I
remember.&nbsp; That would be about four years ago.&nbsp; Of
course, there were a great many people between the present Lord
Illingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.&nbsp; There
was&mdash;who was there, Caroline?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; There was poor
Margaret&rsquo;s baby.&nbsp; You remember how anxious she was to
have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband died
shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of
Lord Ascot&rsquo;s sons, who, I am told, beats her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that is
in the family, dear, that is in the family.&nbsp; And there was
also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic, or a
lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know
the Court of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that
he was quite sane.&nbsp; And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord
Plumstead&rsquo;s with straws in his hair, or something very odd
about him.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t recall what.&nbsp; I often regret,
Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son
get the title.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Lady
Cecilia?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Lord
Illingworth&rsquo;s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one of the
Duchess of Jerningham&rsquo;s pretty daughters, and she married
Sir Thomas Harford, who wasn&rsquo;t considered a very good match
for her at the time, though he was said to be the handsomest man
in London.&nbsp; I knew them all quite intimately, and both the
sons, Arthur and George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; It was the
eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady Hunstanton?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; No, dear, he
was killed in the hunting field.&nbsp; Or was it fishing,
Caroline?&nbsp; I forget.&nbsp; But George came in for
everything.&nbsp; I always tell him that no younger son has ever
had such good luck as he has had.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Lady
Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once.&nbsp; Might I see
him?&nbsp; Can he be sent for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Certainly,
dear.&nbsp; I will send one of the servants into the dining-room
to fetch him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what keeps the gentlemen
so long.&nbsp; [<i>Rings bell</i>.]&nbsp; When I knew Lord
Illingworth first as plain George Harford, he was simply a very
brilliant young man about town, with not a penny of money except
what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.&nbsp; She was quite devoted
to him.&nbsp; Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms with
his father.&nbsp; Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.&nbsp; [<i>To
Servant</i>.]&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John</span> <i>and</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Doctor Baubeny</span>.]&nbsp; You see I have
got Mrs. Arbuthnot to come to me at last.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Archdeacon</span>.&nbsp; That is a
great honour, Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; Mrs. Daubeny will be quite
jealous of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I am so
sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you to-night.&nbsp;
Headache as usual, I suppose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Archdeacon</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Lady
Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.&nbsp; But she is happiest
alone.&nbsp; She is happiest alone.</p>

both quite well, thank you, Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; But what a
short time you have been in the dining-room!&nbsp; It seems as if
we had only just left.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I was bored
to death.&nbsp; Never opened my lips the whole time.&nbsp;
Absolutely longing to come in to you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; You should
have.&nbsp; The American girl has been giving us a lecture.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp;
Really?&nbsp; All Americans lecture, I believe.&nbsp; I suppose
it is something in their climate.&nbsp; What did she lecture
about?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Oh, Puritanism,
of course.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I am going
to convert her, am I not?&nbsp; How long do you give me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; A week.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; A week is
more than enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Not to-night,

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Lord Illingworth, I

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; With the

isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I hope he won&rsquo;t be disappointed in
me, that is all.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll thank Lord Illingworth,

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Lord
Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest himself in you
for the moment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting
his hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald&rsquo;s</span>
<i>shoulder</i>.]&nbsp; Oh, Gerald and I are great friends
already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; There can be
nothing in common between you and my son, Lord Illingworth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Dear mother, how can
you say so?&nbsp; Of course Lord Illingworth is awfully clever
and that sort of thing.&nbsp; There is nothing Lord Illingworth
doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; My dear
boy!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; He knows more about
life than any one I have ever met.&nbsp; I feel an awful duffer
when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; Of course, I have had
so few advantages.&nbsp; I have not been to Eton or Oxford like
other chaps.&nbsp; But Lord Illingworth doesn&rsquo;t seem to
mind that.&nbsp; He has been awfully good to me, mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Lord
Illingworth may change his mind.&nbsp; He may not really want you
as his secretary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; You must
remember, as you said yourself, you have had so few
advantages.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Lord
Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.&nbsp; Do come
over.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Will you
excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t let your
charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.&nbsp; The
thing is quite settled, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I hope so.&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span> <i>goes across
to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I thought you

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; She is
excessively handsome.&nbsp; [<i>Looks at</i> <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Caroline,
shall we all make a move to the music-room?&nbsp; Miss Worsley is
going to play.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,
won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what a treat is in
store for you.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor
Baubeny</span>.]&nbsp; I must really take Miss Worsley down some
afternoon to the rectory.&nbsp; I should so much like dear Mrs.
Daubeny to hear her on the violin.&nbsp; Ah, I forgot.&nbsp; Dear
Mrs. Daubeny&rsquo;s hearing is a little defective, is it
not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Archdeacon</span>.&nbsp; Her deafness
is a great privation to her.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t even hear my
sermons now.&nbsp; She reads them at home.&nbsp; But she has many
resources in herself, many resources.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; She reads a
good deal, I suppose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Archdeacon</span>.&nbsp; Just the very
largest print.&nbsp; The eyesight is rapidly going.&nbsp; But
she&rsquo;s never morbid, never morbid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.]&nbsp; Do speak to my
mother, Lord Illingworth, before you go into the
music-room.&nbsp; She seems to think, somehow, you don&rsquo;t
mean what you said to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t
you coming?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; In a few
moments.&nbsp; Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot would allow me,
I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join you
later on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah, of
course.&nbsp; You will have a great deal to say to her, and she
will have a great deal to thank you for.&nbsp; It is not every
son who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.&nbsp; But I know you
appreciate that, dear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; John!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Now,
don&rsquo;t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord Illingworth.&nbsp;
We can&rsquo;t spare her.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit following the other guests</i>.&nbsp; <i>Sound of

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; So that is
our son, Rachel!&nbsp; Well, I am very proud of him.&nbsp; He in
a Harford, every inch of him.&nbsp; By the way, why Arbuthnot,
Rachel?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; One name is
as good as another, when one has no right to any name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I suppose
so&mdash;but why Gerald?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; After a man
whose heart I broke&mdash;after my father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Well,
Rachel, what in over is over.&nbsp; All I have got to say now in
that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.&nbsp; The world
will know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will
be something very near, and very dear.&nbsp; It is a curious
thing, Rachel; my life seemed to be quite complete.&nbsp; It was
not so.&nbsp; It lacked something, it lacked a son.&nbsp; I have
found my son now, I am glad I have found him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; You have no
right to claim him, or the smallest part of him.&nbsp; The boy is
entirely mine, and shall remain mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; My dear
Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over twenty years.&nbsp;
Why not let me have him for a little now?&nbsp; He is quite as
much mine as yours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Are you
talking of the child you abandoned?&nbsp; Of the child who, as
far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of
want?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; You forget,
Rachel, it was you who left me.&nbsp; It was not I who left
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I left you
because you refused to give the child a name.&nbsp; Before my son
was born, I implored you to marry me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I had no
expectations then.&nbsp; And besides, Rachel, I wasn&rsquo;t much
older than you were.&nbsp; I was only twenty-two.&nbsp; I was
twenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your
father&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; When a man is
old enough to do wrong he should be old enough to do right
also.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; My dear
Rachel, intellectual generalities are always interesting, but
generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.&nbsp; As for
saying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and
silly.&nbsp; My mother offered you six hundred a year.&nbsp; But
you wouldn&rsquo;t take anything.&nbsp; You simply disappeared,
and carried the child away with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t have accepted a penny from her.&nbsp; Your father
was different.&nbsp; He told you, in my presence, when we were in
Paris, that it was your duty to marry me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Oh, duty is
what one expects from others, it is not what one does
oneself.&nbsp; Of course, I was influenced by my mother.&nbsp;
Every man is when he is young.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I am glad to
hear you say so.&nbsp; Gerald shall certainly not go away with
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; What
nonsense, Rachel!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Do you think
I would allow my son&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; <i>Our</i>
son.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; My son [<span
class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span> <i>shrugs his
shoulders</i>]&mdash;to go away with the man who spoiled my
youth, who ruined my life, who has tainted every moment of my
days?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t realise what my past has been in
suffering and in shame.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; My dear
Rachel, I must candidly say that I think Gerald&rsquo;s future
considerably more important than your past.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Gerald cannot
separate his future from my past.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; That is
exactly what he should do.&nbsp; That is exactly what you should
help him to do.&nbsp; What a typical woman you are!&nbsp; You
talk sentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole
time.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t let us have a scene.&nbsp; Rachel, I
want you to look at this matter from the common-sense point of
view, from the point of view of what is best for our son, leaving
you and me out of the question.&nbsp; What is our son at
present?&nbsp; An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a
third-rate English town.&nbsp; If you imagine he is quite happy
in such a position, you are mistaken.&nbsp; He is thoroughly
discontented.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; He was not
discontented till he met you.&nbsp; You have made him so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Of course,
I made him so.&nbsp; Discontent is the first step in the progress
of a man or a nation.&nbsp; But I did not leave him with a mere
longing for things he could not get.&nbsp; No, I made him a
charming offer.&nbsp; He jumped at it, I need hardly say.&nbsp;
Any young man would.&nbsp; And now, simply because it turns out
that I am the boy&rsquo;s own father and he my own son, you
propose practically to ruin his career.&nbsp; That is to say, if
I were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with
me, but as he is my own flesh and blood you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
How utterly illogical you are!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I will not
allow him to go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; How can you
prevent it?&nbsp; What excuse can you give to him for making him
decline such an offer as mine?&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t tell him in
what relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.&nbsp; But you
daren&rsquo;t tell him.&nbsp; You know that.&nbsp; Look how you
have brought him up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I have
brought him up to be a good man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Quite
so.&nbsp; And what is the result?&nbsp; You have educated him to
be your judge if he ever finds you out.&nbsp; And a bitter, an
unjust judge he will be to you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be deceived,
Rachel.&nbsp; Children begin by loving their parents.&nbsp; After
a time they judge them.&nbsp; Rarely, if ever, do they forgive
them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; George,
don&rsquo;t take my son away from me.&nbsp; I have had twenty
years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only
one thing to love.&nbsp; You have had a life of joy, and
pleasure, and success.&nbsp; You have been quite happy, you have
never thought of us.&nbsp; There was no reason, according to your
views of life, why you should have remembered us at all.&nbsp;
Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible accident.&nbsp;
Forget it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t come now, and rob me of . . . of all
I have in the whole world.&nbsp; You are so rich in other
things.&nbsp; Leave me the little vineyard of my life; leave me
the walled-in garden and the well of water; the ewe-lamb God sent
me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that.&nbsp; George,
don&rsquo;t take Gerald from me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Rachel, at
the present moment you are not necessary to Gerald&rsquo;s
career; I am.&nbsp; There is nothing more to be said on the
subject.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I will not
let him go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Here is
Gerald.&nbsp; He has a right to decide for himself.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Well, dear mother, I
hope you have settled it all with Lord Illingworth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I have not,
Gerald.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Your mother
seems not to like your coming with me, for some reason.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Why, mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I thought you
were quite happy here with me, Gerald.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know
you were so anxious to leave me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, how can you
talk like that?&nbsp; Of course I have been quite happy with
you.&nbsp; But a man can&rsquo;t stay always with his
mother.&nbsp; No chap does.&nbsp; I want to make myself a
position, to do something.&nbsp; I thought you would have been
proud to see me Lord Illingworth&rsquo;s secretary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I do not
think you would be suitable as a private secretary to Lord
Illingworth.&nbsp; You have no qualifications.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs.
Arbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I
surely am the best judge.&nbsp; And I can only tell you that your
son has all the qualifications I had hoped for.&nbsp; He has
more, in fact, than I had even thought of.&nbsp; Far more.&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span> <i>remains
silent</i>.]&nbsp; Have you any other reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why
you don&rsquo;t wish your son to accept this post?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Have you,
mother?&nbsp; Do answer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; If you
have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.&nbsp; We are quite by
ourselves here.&nbsp; Whatever it is, I need not say I will not
repeat it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; If you
would like to be alone with your son, I will leave you.&nbsp; You
may have some other reason you don&rsquo;t wish me to hear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I have no
other reason.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Then, my
dear boy, we may look on the thing as settled.&nbsp; Come, you
and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together.&nbsp; And
Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted
very, very wisely.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit with</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp;

<h2>THIRD ACT</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">SCENE</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Picture Gallery at
Hunstanton</i>.&nbsp; <i>Door at back leading on to
terrace</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Gerald</span>, R.C.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lord
Illingworth</span> <i>lolling on a sofa</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Gerald</span> <i>in a chair</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Thoroughly
sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.&nbsp; I knew she would come
round in the end.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; My mother is awfully
conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know she doesn&rsquo;t
think I am educated enough to be your secretary.&nbsp; She is
perfectly right, too.&nbsp; I was fearfully idle when I was at
school, and I couldn&rsquo;t pass an examination now to save my
life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; My dear
Gerald, examinations are of no value whatsoever.&nbsp; If a man
is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a
gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But I am so ignorant
of the world, Lord Illingworth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
be afraid, Gerald.&nbsp; Remember that you&rsquo;ve got on your
side the most wonderful thing in the world&mdash;youth!&nbsp;
There is nothing like youth.&nbsp; The middle-aged are mortgaged
to Life.&nbsp; The old are in life&rsquo;s lumber-room.&nbsp; But
youth is the Lord of Life.&nbsp; Youth has a kingdom waiting for
it.&nbsp; Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
like most kings.&nbsp; To win back my youth, Gerald, there is
nothing I wouldn&rsquo;t do&mdash;except take exercise, get up
early, or be a useful member of the community.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t
call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I am old
enough to be your father, Gerald.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
remember my father; he died years ago.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; So Lady
Hunstanton told me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; It is very curious,
my mother never talks to me about my father.&nbsp; I sometimes
think she must have married beneath her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Winces
slightly</i>.]&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; [<i>Goes over and puts his
hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald&rsquo;s</span>
<i>shoulder</i>.]&nbsp; You have missed not having a father, I
suppose, Gerald?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Oh, no; my mother has
been so good to me.&nbsp; No one ever had such a mother as I have
had.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I am quite
sure of that.&nbsp; Still I should imagine that most mothers
don&rsquo;t quite understand their sons.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
realise, I mean, that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life,
to make himself a name.&nbsp; After all, Gerald, you
couldn&rsquo;t be expected to pass all your life in such a hole
as Wrockley, could you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; It
would be dreadful!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; A
mother&rsquo;s love is very touching, of course, but it is often
curiously selfish.&nbsp; I mean, there is a good deal of
selfishness in it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Slowly</i>.]&nbsp; I suppose there is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Your mother
is a thoroughly good woman.&nbsp; But good women have such
limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their interests
are so petty, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; They are awfully
interested, certainly, in things we don&rsquo;t care much
about.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I suppose
your mother is very religious, and that sort of thing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Oh, yes, she&rsquo;s
always going to church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Ah! she is
not modern, and to be modern is the only thing worth being
nowadays.&nbsp; You want to be modern, don&rsquo;t you,
Gerald?&nbsp; You want to know life as it really is.&nbsp; Not to
be put of with any old-fashioned theories about life.&nbsp; Well,
what you have to do at present is simply to fit yourself for the
best society.&nbsp; A man who can dominate a London dinner-table
can dominate the world.&nbsp; The future belongs to the
dandy.&nbsp; It is the exquisites who are going to rule.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I should like to wear
nice things awfully, but I have always been told that a man
should not think too much about his clothes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; People
nowadays are so absolutely superficial that they don&rsquo;t
understand the philosophy of the superficial.&nbsp; By the way,
Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.&nbsp;
Sentiment is all very well for the button-hole.&nbsp; But the
essential thing for a necktie is style.&nbsp; A well-tied tie is
the first serious step in life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Laughing</i>.]&nbsp; I might be able to learn how to tie a
tie, Lord Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you
do.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how to talk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Oh! talk to
every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored
you, and at the end of your first season you will have the
reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But it is very
difficult to get into society isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; To get into
the best society, nowadays, one has either to feed people, amuse
people, or shock people&mdash;that is all!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I suppose society is
wonderfully delightful!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; To be in it
is merely a bore.&nbsp; But to be out of it simply a
tragedy.&nbsp; Society is a necessary thing.&nbsp; No man has any
real success in this world unless he has got women to back him,
and women rule society.&nbsp; If you have not got women on your
side you are quite over.&nbsp; You might just as well be a
barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at once.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; It is very difficult
to understand women, is it not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; You should
never try to understand them.&nbsp; Women are pictures.&nbsp; Men
are problems.&nbsp; If you want to know what a woman really
means&mdash;which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to
do&mdash;look at her, don&rsquo;t listen to her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But women are awfully
clever, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; One should
always tell them so.&nbsp; But, to the philosopher, my dear
Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over
mind&mdash;just as men represent the triumph of mind over
morals.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; How then can women
have so much power as you say they have?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; The history
of women is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world
has ever known.&nbsp; The tyranny of the weak over the
strong.&nbsp; It is the only tyranny that lasts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But haven&rsquo;t
women got a refining influence?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Nothing
refines but the intellect.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Still, there are many
different kinds of women, aren&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Only two
kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But there are good
women in society, aren&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Far too
many.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But do you think
women shouldn&rsquo;t be good?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; One should
never tell them so, they&rsquo;d all become good at once.&nbsp;
Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.&nbsp; Every woman is a
rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; You have never been
married, Lord Illingworth, have you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Men marry
because they are tired; women because they are curious.&nbsp;
Both are disappointed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you
think one can be happy when one is married?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Perfectly
happy.&nbsp; But the happiness of a married man, my dear Gerald,
depends on the people he has not married.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But if one is in
love?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; One should
always be in love.&nbsp; That is the reason one should never
marry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Love is a very
wonderful thing, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; When one is
in love one begins by deceiving oneself.&nbsp; And one ends by
deceiving others.&nbsp; That is what the world calls a
romance.&nbsp; But a really <i>grande passion</i> is
comparatively rare nowadays.&nbsp; It is the privilege of people
who have nothing to do.&nbsp; That is the one use of the idle
classes in a country, and the only possible explanation of us
Harfords.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Harfords, Lord
Illingworth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; That is my
family name.&nbsp; You should study the Peerage, Gerald.&nbsp; It
is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly,
and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever
done.&nbsp; And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new
life with me, and I want you to know how to live.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span> <i>appears on terrace
behind</i>.]&nbsp; For the world has been made by fools that wise
men should live in it!</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> L.C. <span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Daubeny</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah! here you
are, dear Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; Well, I suppose you have been
telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new duties are to be,
and giving him a great deal of good advice over a pleasant
cigarette.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I have been
giving him the best of advice, Lady Hunstanton, and the best of
cigarettes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I am so
sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I suppose I am too old
now to learn.&nbsp; Except from you, dear Archdeacon, when you
are in your nice pulpit.&nbsp; But then I always know what you
are going to say, so I don&rsquo;t feel alarmed.&nbsp;
[<i>Sees</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.]&nbsp;
Ah! dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.&nbsp; Come,
dear.&nbsp; [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Arbuthnot</span>.]&nbsp; Gerald has been having such a long talk
with Lord Illingworth; I am sure you must feel very much
flattered at the pleasant way in which everything has turned out
for him.&nbsp; Let us sit down.&nbsp; [<i>They sit
down</i>.]&nbsp; And how is your beautiful embroidery going
on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I am always
at work, Lady Hunstanton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Mrs. Daubeny
embroiders a little, too, doesn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Archdeacon</span>.&nbsp; She was very
deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.&nbsp; But the gout has
crippled her fingers a good deal.&nbsp; She has not touched the
tambour frame for nine or ten years.&nbsp; But she has many other
amusements.&nbsp; She is very much interested in her own
health.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah! that is
always a nice distraction, in it not?&nbsp; Now, what are you
talking about, Lord Illingworth?&nbsp; Do tell us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I was on
the point of explaining to Gerald that the world has always
laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in which it
has been able to bear them.&nbsp; And that, consequently,
whatever the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy
side of things.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Now I am
quite out of my depth.&nbsp; I usually am when Lord Illingworth
says anything.&nbsp; And the Humane Society is most
careless.&nbsp; They never rescue me.&nbsp; I am left to
sink.&nbsp; I have a dim idea, dear Lord Illingworth, that you
are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I always try to
be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.&nbsp;
And after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning
person.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; The only
difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint
has a past, and every sinner has a future.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah! that
quite does for me.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t a word to say.&nbsp; You
and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.&nbsp; We
can&rsquo;t follow Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; Too much care was
taken with our education, I am afraid.&nbsp; To have been well
brought up is a great drawback nowadays.&nbsp; It shuts one out
from so much.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I should be
sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of his opinions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; You are
quite right, dear.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Gerald</span> <i>shrugs his shoulders and
looks irritably over at his mother</i>.&nbsp; <i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Jane, have you
seen John anywhere?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; You
needn&rsquo;t be anxious about him, dear.&nbsp; He is with Lady
Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow
Drawing-room.&nbsp; They seem quite happy together.&nbsp; You are
not going, Caroline?&nbsp; Pray sit down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; I think I had
better look after John.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; It
doesn&rsquo;t do to pay men so much attention.&nbsp; And Caroline
has really nothing to be anxious about.&nbsp; Lady Stutfield is
very sympathetic.&nbsp; She is just as sympathetic about one
thing as she is about another.&nbsp; A beautiful nature.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.]</p>
<p>Ah! here is Sir John!&nbsp; And with Mrs. Allonby too!&nbsp; I
suppose it was Mrs. Allonby I saw him with.&nbsp; Sir John,
Caroline has been looking everywhere for you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; We have been
waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady Hunstanton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah! the
Music-room, of course.&nbsp; I thought it was the Yellow
Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.&nbsp; [<i>To
the</i> <span class="smcap">Archdeacon</span>.]&nbsp; Mrs.
Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Archdeacon</span>.&nbsp; She used to
be quite remarkable for her memory, but since her last attack she
recalls chiefly the events of her early childhood.&nbsp; But she
finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great pleasure.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Kelvil</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah! dear
Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been talking to you
about?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; About
Bimetallism, as well as I remember.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp;
Bimetallism!&nbsp; Is that quite a nice subject?&nbsp; However, I
know people discuss everything very freely nowadays.&nbsp; What
did Sir John talk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; About
Patagonia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp;
Really?&nbsp; What a remote topic!&nbsp; But very improving, I
have no doubt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; He has been
most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.&nbsp; Savages seem
to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost all
subjects.&nbsp; They are excessively advanced.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; What do they
do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Apparently
everything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Well, it is
very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it not, to find that Human
Nature is permanently one.&mdash;On the whole, the world is the
same world, is it not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; The world
is simply divided into two classes&mdash;those who believe the
incredible, like the public&mdash;and those who do the
improbable&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Like
yourself?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Yes; I am
always astonishing myself.&nbsp; It is the only thing that makes
life worth living.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; And what have
you been doing lately that astonishes you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I have been
discovering all kinds of beautiful qualities in my own
nature.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Ah! don&rsquo;t
become quite perfect all at once.&nbsp; Do it gradually!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t intend to grow perfect at all.&nbsp; At least, I hope
I shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It would be most inconvenient.&nbsp; Women
love us for our defects.&nbsp; If we have enough of them, they
will forgive us everything, even our gigantic intellects.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; It is premature
to ask us to forgive analysis.&nbsp; We forgive adoration; that
is quite as much as should be expected from us.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Alfred</span>.&nbsp;
<i>He joins</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah! we women
should forgive everything, shouldn&rsquo;t we, dear Mrs.
Arbuthnot?&nbsp; I am sure you agree with me in that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I do not,
Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; I think there are many things women should
never forgive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; What sort of
things?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; The ruin of
another woman&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>[<i>Moves slowly away to back of stage</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah! those
things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe there are admirable
homes where people of that kind are looked after and reformed,
and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take
things very, very easily.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; The secret of
life is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Stutfield</span>.&nbsp; The secret of
life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly, terribly
deceived.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kelvil</span>.&nbsp; The secret of life is
to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; There is no
secret of life.&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s aim, if it has one, is simply
to be always looking for temptations.&nbsp; There are not nearly
enough.&nbsp; I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across
a single one.&nbsp; It is quite dreadful.&nbsp; It makes one so
nervous about the future.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Shakes
her fan at him</i>.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how it is, dear
Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me
excessively immoral.&nbsp; It has been most interesting,
listening to you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; All thought
is immoral.&nbsp; Its very essence is destruction.&nbsp; If you
think of anything, you kill it.&nbsp; Nothing survives being
thought of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; But I have
no doubt it is all quite true.&nbsp; Personally, I have very
little to reproach myself with, on the score of thinking.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe in women thinking too much.&nbsp; Women
should think in moderation, as they should do all things in
moderation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Moderation
is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; Nothing succeeds like
excess.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I hope I
shall remember that.&nbsp; It sounds an admirable maxim.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;m beginning to forget everything.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
great misfortune.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; It is one
of your most fascinating qualities, Lady Hunstanton.&nbsp; No
woman should have a memory.&nbsp; Memory in a woman is the
beginning of dowdiness.&nbsp; One can always tell from a
woman&rsquo;s bonnet whether she has got a memory or not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; How charming
you are, dear Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; You always find out that
one&rsquo;s most glaring fault is one&rsquo;s most important
virtue.&nbsp; You have the most comforting views of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; If you really want

it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Mrs. Arbuthnot, I
wish you would let us be friends.&nbsp; You are so different from
the other women here.&nbsp; When you came into the Drawing-room
this evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is
good and pure in life.&nbsp; I had been foolish.&nbsp; There are
things that are right to say, but that may be said at the wrong
time and to the wrong people.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I heard what
you said.&nbsp; I agree with it, Miss Worsley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know
you had heard it.&nbsp; But I knew you would agree with me.&nbsp;
A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn&rsquo;t
she?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; She shouldn&rsquo;t
be allowed to come into the society of good men and women?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; She should
not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; And the man should be
punished in the same way?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; In the same
way.&nbsp; And the children, if there are children, in the same
way also?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Yes, it is right that
the sins of the parents should be visited on the children.&nbsp;
It is a just law.&nbsp; It is God&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; It is one of
God&rsquo;s terrible laws.</p>
<p>[<i>Moves away to fireplace</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; You are distressed
about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Do you like him going
away with Lord Illingworth?&nbsp; Of course there is position, no
doubt, and money, but position and money are not everything, are
they?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; They are
nothing; they bring misery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Then why do you let
your son go with him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; He wishes it
himself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; But if you asked him
he would stay, would he not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; He has set
his heart on going.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
refuse you anything.&nbsp; He loves you too much.&nbsp; Ask him
to stay.&nbsp; Let me send him in to you.&nbsp; He is on the
terrace at this moment with Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; I heard them
laughing together as I passed through the Music-room.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.&nbsp; It is of no
consequence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll tell
him you want him.&nbsp; Do&mdash;do ask him to stay.&nbsp;
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Hester</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Arbuthnot,
may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the terrace?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; No, Lady Caroline, he
is not on the terrace.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.&nbsp; It is very
curious.&nbsp; It is time for him to retire.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Caroline</span>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Dear mother, I am
afraid I kept you waiting.&nbsp; I forgot all about it.&nbsp; I
am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; At the
prospect of going away?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t put it
like that, mother.&nbsp; Of course I am sorry to leave you.&nbsp;
Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.&nbsp; But after
all, as Lord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a
place as Wrockley.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mind it.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m ambitions; I want something more than that.&nbsp; I
want to have a career.&nbsp; I want to do something that will
make you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help
me.&nbsp; He is going to do everything for me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Gerald,
don&rsquo;t go away with Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; I implore you
not to.&nbsp; Gerald, I beg you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, how
changeable you are!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t seem to know your own
mind for a single moment.&nbsp; An hour and a half ago in the
Drawing-room you agreed to the whole thing; now you turn round
and make objections, and try to force me to give up my one chance
in life.&nbsp; Yes, my one chance.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t suppose
that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every day, do you,
mother?&nbsp; It is very strange that when I have had such a
wonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties
in my way should be my own mother.&nbsp; Besides, you know,
mother, I love Hester Worsley.&nbsp; Who could help loving
her?&nbsp; I love her more than I have ever told you, far
more.&nbsp; And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I
could&mdash;I could ask her to&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you understand
now, mother, what it means to me to be Lord Illingworth&rsquo;s
secretary?&nbsp; To start like that is to find a career ready for
one&mdash;before one&mdash;waiting for one.&nbsp; If I were Lord
Illingworth&rsquo;s secretary I could ask Hester to be my
wife.&nbsp; As a wretched bank clerk with a hundred a year it
would be an impertinence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I fear you
need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.&nbsp; I know her views on
life.&nbsp; She has just told them to me.&nbsp; [<i>A
pause</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Then I have my
ambition left, at any rate.&nbsp; That is something&mdash;I am
glad I have that!&nbsp; You have always tried to crush my
ambition, mother&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You have told me
that the world is a wicked place, that success is not worth
having, that society is shallow, and all that sort of
thing&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t believe it, mother.&nbsp; I think
the world must be delightful.&nbsp; I think society must be
exquisite.&nbsp; I think success is a thing worth having.&nbsp;
You have been wrong in all that you taught me, mother, quite
wrong.&nbsp; Lord Illingworth is a successful man.&nbsp; He is a
fashionable man.&nbsp; He is a man who lives in the world and for
it.&nbsp; Well, I would give anything to be just like Lord
Illingworth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I would
sooner see you dead.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, what is your
objection to Lord Illingworth?&nbsp; Tell me&mdash;tell me right
out.&nbsp; What is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; He is a bad
man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; In what way
bad?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I will tell
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I suppose you think
him bad, because he doesn&rsquo;t believe the same things as you
do.&nbsp; Well, men are different from women, mother.&nbsp; It is
natural that they should have different views.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; It is not
what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he does not believe, that
makes him bad.&nbsp; It is what he is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, is it
something you know of him?&nbsp; Something you actually know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; It is
something I know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Something you are
quite sure of?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Quite sure
of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; How long have you
known it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; For twenty
years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Is it fair to go back
twenty years in any man&rsquo;s career?&nbsp; And what have you
or I to do with Lord Illingworth&rsquo;s early life?&nbsp; What
business is it of ours?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; What this man
has been, he is now, and will be always.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, tell me what
Lord Illingworth did?&nbsp; If he did anything shameful, I will
not go away with him.&nbsp; Surely you know me well enough for
that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Gerald, come
near to me.&nbsp; Quite close to me, as you used to do when you
were a little boy, when you were mother&rsquo;s own boy.&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">Gerald</span> <i>sits down betide his
mother</i>.&nbsp; <i>She runs her fingers through his hair</i>,
<i>and strokes his hands</i>.]&nbsp; Gerald, there was a girl
once, she was very young, she was little over eighteen at the
time.&nbsp; George Harford&mdash;that was Lord
Illingworth&rsquo;s name then&mdash;George Harford met her.&nbsp;
She knew nothing about life.&nbsp; He&mdash;knew
everything.&nbsp; He made this girl love him.&nbsp; He made her
love him so much that she left her father&rsquo;s house with him
one morning.&nbsp; She loved him so much, and he had promised to
marry her!&nbsp; He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she
had believed him.&nbsp; She was very young, and&mdash;and
ignorant of what life really is.&nbsp; But he put the marriage
off from week to week, and month to month.&mdash;She trusted in
him all the while.&nbsp; She loved him.&mdash;Before her child
was born&mdash;for she had a child&mdash;she implored him for the
child&rsquo;s sake to marry her, that the child might have a
name, that her sin might not be visited on the child, who was
innocent.&nbsp; He refused.&nbsp; After the child was born she
left him, taking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her
soul ruined, and all that was sweet, and good, and pure in her
ruined also.&nbsp; She suffered terribly&mdash;she suffers
now.&nbsp; She will always suffer.&nbsp; For her there is no joy,
no peace, no atonement.&nbsp; She is a woman who drags a chain
like a guilty thing.&nbsp; She is a woman who wears a mask, like
a thing that is a leper.&nbsp; The fire cannot purify her.&nbsp;
The waters cannot quench her anguish.&nbsp; Nothing can heal her!
no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies forgetfulness!&nbsp;
She is lost!&nbsp; She is a lost soul!&mdash;That is why I call
Lord Illingworth a bad man.&nbsp; That is why I don&rsquo;t want
my boy to be with him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; My dear mother, it
all sounds very tragic, of course.&nbsp; But I dare say the girl
was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth was.&mdash;After
all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings at
all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not
married, and live with him as his wife?&nbsp; No nice girl
would.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; [<i>After a
pause</i>.]&nbsp; Gerald, I withdraw all my objections.&nbsp; You
are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when and where
you choose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Dear mother, I knew
you wouldn&rsquo;t stand in my way.&nbsp; You are the best woman
God ever made.&nbsp; And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don&rsquo;t
believe he is capable of anything infamous or base.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t believe it of him&mdash;I can&rsquo;t.</p>

morning, Mrs. Allonby.</p>

Gerald.&nbsp; I hope she is better?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; My mother has not
come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I am
afraid the heat was too much for her last night.&nbsp; I think
there must have been thunder in the air.&nbsp; Or perhaps it was
the music.&nbsp; Music makes one feel so romantic&mdash;at least
it always gets on one&rsquo;s nerves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
same thing, nowadays.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; I am so glad
I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, dear.&nbsp; I am afraid you
mean something wrong.&nbsp; Ah, I see you&rsquo;re examining Mrs.

mother&rsquo;s good influence in everything she has about her,
Gerald.</p>

Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that a good

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; It would do
him a great deal of good, dear.&nbsp; Most women in London,
nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but orchids,
foreigners, and French novels.&nbsp; But here we have the room of
a sweet saint.&nbsp; Fresh natural flowers, books that
don&rsquo;t shock one, pictures that one can look at without
blushing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; But I like
blushing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Well, there
<i>is</i> a good deal to be said for blushing, if one can do it
at the proper moment.&nbsp; Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell me
I didn&rsquo;t blush nearly often enough.&nbsp; But then he was
so very particular.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t let me know any of
his men friends, except those who were over seventy, like poor
Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way, was brought into the
Divorce Court.&nbsp; A most unfortunate case.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I delight in
men over seventy.&nbsp; They always offer one the devotion of a
lifetime.&nbsp; I think seventy an ideal age for a man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; She is quite
incorrigible, Gerald, isn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; By-the-by, Gerald, I
hope your dear mother will come and see me more often now.&nbsp;
You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don&rsquo;t
you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I have given up my
intention of being Lord Illingworth&rsquo;s secretary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Surely not,
Gerald!&nbsp; It would be most unwise of you.&nbsp; What reason
can you have?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I
should be suitable for the post.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I wish Lord
Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.&nbsp; But he says I
am not serious enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear, you
really mustn&rsquo;t talk like that in this house.&nbsp; Mrs.
Arbuthnot doesn&rsquo;t know anything about the wicked society in
which we all live.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t go into it.&nbsp; She is
far too good.&nbsp; I consider it was a great honour her coming
to me last night.&nbsp; It gave quite an atmosphere of
respectability to the party.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that must
have been what you thought was thunder in the air.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; My dear, how
can you say that?&nbsp; There is no resemblance between the two
things at all.&nbsp; But really, Gerald, what do you mean by not
being suitable?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Lord
Illingworth&rsquo;s views of life and mine are too different.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; But, my dear
Gerald, at your age you shouldn&rsquo;t have any views of
life.&nbsp; They are quite out of place.&nbsp; You must be guided
by others in this matter.&nbsp; Lord Illingworth has made you the
most flattering offer, and travelling with him you would see the
world&mdash;as much of it, at least, as one should look
at&mdash;under the best auspices possible, and stay with all the
right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in your
career.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to
see the world: I&rsquo;ve seen enough of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; I hope you
don&rsquo;t think you have exhausted life, Mr. Arbuthnot.&nbsp;
When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to
leave my mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Now, Gerald,
that is pure laziness on your part.&nbsp; Not leave your
mother!&nbsp; If I were your mother I would insist on your
going.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alice</span> L.C.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>.&nbsp; Mrs. Arbuthnot&rsquo;s
compliments, my lady, but she has a bad headache, and cannot see
any one this morning.&nbsp; [<i>Exit</i> R.C.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Rising</i>.]&nbsp; A bad headache!&nbsp; I am so sorry!&nbsp;
Perhaps you&rsquo;ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon,
if she is better, Gerald.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I am afraid not this
afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; Well,
to-morrow, then.&nbsp; Ah, if you had a father, Gerald, he
wouldn&rsquo;t let you waste your life here.&nbsp; He would send
you off with Lord Illingworth at once.&nbsp; But mothers are so
weak.&nbsp; They give up to their sons in everything.&nbsp; We
are all heart, all heart.&nbsp; Come, dear, I must call at the
rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid, is far
from well.&nbsp; It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up,
quite wonderful.&nbsp; He is the most sympathetic of
husbands.&nbsp; Quite a model.&nbsp; Good-bye, Gerald, give my
fondest love to your mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; Good-bye, Mr.
Arbuthnot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Good-bye.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; What name can I
sign?&nbsp; I, who have no right to any name.&nbsp; [<i>Signs

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hunstanton</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Through
French window at the back</i>.]&nbsp; Good-bye again,
Gerald.&nbsp; We are taking the short cut across your pretty
garden.&nbsp; Now, remember my advice to you&mdash;start at once
with Lord Illingworth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allonby</span>.&nbsp; <i>Au
revoir</i>, Mr. Arbuthnot.&nbsp; Mind you bring me back something
nice from your travels&mdash;not an Indian shawl&mdash;on no
account an Indian shawl.</p>
<p>[<i>Exeunt</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, I have just
written to him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; To whom?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; To my father.&nbsp; I
have written to tell him to come here at four o&rsquo;clock this
afternoon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; He shall not
come here.&nbsp; He shall not cross the threshold of my
house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; He must come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Gerald, if
you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go at once.&nbsp; Go
before it kills me: but don&rsquo;t ask me to meet him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, you
don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Nothing in the world would induce
me to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.&nbsp;
Surely you know me well enough for that.&nbsp; No: I have written
to him to say&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; What can you
have to say to him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you
guess, mother, what I have written in this letter?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; No.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, surely you
can.&nbsp; Think, think what must be done, now, at once, within
the next few days.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; There is
nothing to be done.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I have written to
Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must marry you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Marry me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, I will force
him to do it.&nbsp; The wrong that has been done you must be
repaired.&nbsp; Atonement must be made.&nbsp; Justice may be
slow, mother, but it comes in the end.&nbsp; In a few days you
shall be Lord Illingworth&rsquo;s lawful wife.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; But,
Gerald&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I will insist upon
his doing it.&nbsp; I will make him do it: he will not dare to
refuse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; But, Gerald,
it is I who refuse.&nbsp; I will not marry Lord Illingworth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Not marry him?&nbsp;
Mother!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I will not
marry him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t
understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not for mine.&nbsp;
This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which for
obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me,
will not give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to
bear.&nbsp; But surely it will be something for you, that you, my
mother, should, however late, become the wife of the man who is
my father.&nbsp; Will not that be something?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I will not
marry him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, you must.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I will
not.&nbsp; You talk of atonement for a wrong done.&nbsp; What
atonement can be made to me?&nbsp; There is no atonement
possible.&nbsp; I am disgraced: he is not.&nbsp; That is
all.&nbsp; It is the usual history of a man and a woman as it
usually happens, as it always happens.&nbsp; And the ending is
the ordinary ending.&nbsp; The woman suffers.&nbsp; The man goes
free.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if
that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it is not.&nbsp; But
your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.&nbsp; The man
shall make whatever reparation is possible.&nbsp; It is not
enough.&nbsp; It does not wipe out the past, I know that.&nbsp;
But at least it makes the future better, better for you,
mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I refuse to
marry Lord Illingworth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; If he came to you
himself and asked you to be his wife you would give him a
different answer.&nbsp; Remember, he is my father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; If he came
himself, which he will not do, my answer would be the same.&nbsp;
Remember I am your mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, you make it
terribly difficult for me by talking like that; and I can&rsquo;t
understand why you won&rsquo;t look at this matter from the
right, from the only proper standpoint.&nbsp; It is to take away
the bitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that
lies on your name, that this marriage must take place.&nbsp;
There is no alternative: and after the marriage you and I can go
away together.&nbsp; But the marriage must take place
first.&nbsp; It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself,
but to all other women&mdash;yes: to all the other women in the
world, lest he betray more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I owe nothing
to other women.&nbsp; There is not one of them to help me.&nbsp;
There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for pity,
if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.&nbsp;
Women are hard on each other.&nbsp; That girl, last night, good
though she is, fled from the room as though I were a tainted
thing.&nbsp; She was right.&nbsp; I am a tainted thing.&nbsp; But
my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.&nbsp; I must
bear them alone.&nbsp; What have women who have not sinned to do
with me, or I with them?&nbsp; We do not understand each
other.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hester</span>
<i>behind</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I implore you to do
what I ask you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; What son has
ever asked of his mother to make so hideous a sacrifice?&nbsp;
None.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; What mother has ever
refused to marry the father of her own child?&nbsp; None.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Let me be the
first, then.&nbsp; I will not do it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, you believe
in religion, and you brought me up to believe in it also.&nbsp;
Well, surely your religion, the religion that you taught me when
I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.&nbsp; You
know it, you feel it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I do not know
it.&nbsp; I do not feel it, nor will I ever stand before
God&rsquo;s altar and ask God&rsquo;s blessing on so hideous a
mockery as a marriage between me and George Harford.&nbsp; I will
not say the words the Church bids us to say.&nbsp; I will not say
them.&nbsp; I dare not.&nbsp; How could I swear to love the man I
loathe, to honour him who wrought you dishonour, to obey him who,
in his mastery, made me to sin?&nbsp; No: marriage is a sacrament
for those who love each other.&nbsp; It is not for such as him,
or such as me.&nbsp; Gerald, to save you from the world&rsquo;s
sneers and taunts I have lied to the world.&nbsp; For twenty
years I have lied to the world.&nbsp; I could not tell the world
the truth.&nbsp; Who can, ever?&nbsp; But not for my own sake
will I lie to God, and in God&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; No, Gerald,
no ceremony, Church-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to
George Harford.&nbsp; It may be that I am too bound to him
already, who, robbing me, yet left me richer, so that in the mire
of my life I found the pearl of price, or what I thought would be
so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
understand you now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Men
don&rsquo;t understand what mothers are.&nbsp; I am no different
from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I did,
and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.&nbsp; And yet,
to bear you I had to look on death.&nbsp; To nurture you I had to
wrestle with it.&nbsp; Death fought with me for you.&nbsp; All
women have to fight with death to keep their children.&nbsp;
Death, being childless, wants our children from us.&nbsp; Gerald,
when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave
you food.&nbsp; Night and day all that long winter I tended
you.&nbsp; No office is too mean, no care too lowly for the thing
we women love&mdash;and oh! how <i>I</i> loved <i>you</i>.&nbsp;
Not Hannah, Samuel more.&nbsp; And you needed love, for you were
weakly, and only love could have kept you alive.&nbsp; Only love
can keep any one alive.&nbsp; And boys are careless often and
without thinking give pain, and we always fancy that when they
come to man&rsquo;s estate and know us better they will repay
us.&nbsp; But it is not so.&nbsp; The world draws them from our
side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they
are with us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and
interests that are not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for
when they find life bitter they blame us for it, and when they
find it sweet we do not taste its sweetness with them . . . You
made many friends and went into their houses and were glad with
them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to follow, but
stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat in
darkness.&nbsp; What should I have done in honest
households?&nbsp; My past was ever with me. . . . And you thought
I didn&rsquo;t care for the pleasant things of life.&nbsp; I tell
you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them, feeling I
had no right.&nbsp; You thought I was happier working amongst the
poor.&nbsp; That was my mission, you imagined.&nbsp; It was not,
but where else was I to go?&nbsp; The sick do not ask if the hand
that smooths their pillow is pure, nor the dying care if the lips
that touch their brow have known the kiss of sin.&nbsp; It was
you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the love you did
not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . . And
you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and
in Church duties.&nbsp; But where else could I turn?&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s house is the only house where sinners are made
welcome, and you were always in my heart, Gerald, too much in my
heart.&nbsp; For, though day after day, at morn or evensong, I
have knelt in God&rsquo;s house, I have never repented of my
sin.&nbsp; How could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were
its fruit!&nbsp; Even now that you are bitter to me I cannot
repent.&nbsp; I do not.&nbsp; You are more to me than
innocence.&nbsp; I would rather be your mother&mdash;oh! much
rather!&mdash;than have been always pure . . . Oh, don&rsquo;t
you see? don&rsquo;t you understand?&nbsp; It is my dishonour
that has made you so dear to me.&nbsp; It is my disgrace that has
bound you so closely to me.&nbsp; It is the price I paid for
you&mdash;the price of soul and body&mdash;that makes me love you
as I do.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t ask me to do this horrible
thing.&nbsp; Child of my shame, be still the child of my
shame!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Mother, I
didn&rsquo;t know you loved me so much as that.&nbsp; And I will
be a better son to you than I have been.&nbsp; And you and I must
never leave each other . . . but, mother . . . I can&rsquo;t help
it . . . you must become my father&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; You must
marry him.&nbsp; It is your duty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running forwards
and embracing</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Arbuthnot</span>.]&nbsp; No, no; you shall not.&nbsp; That would
be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.&nbsp; That
would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.&nbsp; Leave him
and come with me.&nbsp; There are other countries than England .
. . Oh! other countries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust
lands.&nbsp; The world is very wide and very big.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; No, not for
me.&nbsp; For me the world is shrivelled to a palm&rsquo;s
breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; It shall not be
so.&nbsp; We shall somewhere find green valleys and fresh waters,
and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.&nbsp; Have we not
both loved him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Hester!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Waving him
back</i>.]&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You cannot love
me at all, unless you love her also.&nbsp; You cannot honour me,
unless she&rsquo;s holier to you.&nbsp; In her all womanhood is
martyred.&nbsp; Not she alone, but all of us are stricken in her
house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Hester, Hester, what
shall I do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Do you respect the
man who is your father?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Respect him?&nbsp; I
despise him!&nbsp; He is infamous.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; I thank you for
saving me from him last night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that is
nothing.&nbsp; I would die to save you.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t
tell me what to do now!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Have I not thanked
you for saving <i>me</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; But what should I
do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Ask your own heart,
not mine.&nbsp; I never had a mother to save, or shame.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; He is
hard&mdash;he is hard.&nbsp; Let me go away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rushes over and
kneels down bedside his mother</i>.]&nbsp; Mother, forgive me: I
have been to blame.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
kiss my hands: they are cold.&nbsp; My heart is cold: something
has broken it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Ah, don&rsquo;t say
that.&nbsp; Hearts live by being wounded.&nbsp; Pleasure may turn
a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but
sorrow&mdash;oh, sorrow cannot break it.&nbsp; Besides, what
sorrows have you now?&nbsp; Why, at this moment you are more dear
to him than ever, <i>dear</i> though you have <i>been</i>, and
oh! how dear you <i>have</i> been always.&nbsp; Ah! be kind to
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.&nbsp; You are my mother and
my father all in one.&nbsp; I need no second parent.&nbsp; It was
for you I spoke, for you alone.&nbsp; Oh, say something,
mother.&nbsp; Have I but found one love to lose another?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t tell me that.&nbsp; O mother, you are cruel.&nbsp;
[<i>Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a sofa</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Hester</span>.]&nbsp; But has he found indeed
another love?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; You know I have loved
him always.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; But we are
very poor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Who, being loved, is
poor?&nbsp; Oh, no one.&nbsp; I hate my riches.&nbsp; They are a
burden.&nbsp; Let him share it with me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; But we are
disgraced.&nbsp; We rank among the outcasts Gerald is
nameless.&nbsp; The sins of the parents should be visited on the
children.&nbsp; It is God&rsquo;s law.</p>

with . . . her&mdash;oh, think of me sometimes.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t

pray when we are happiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hester</span>.&nbsp; Oh, you don&rsquo;t

strongly, terribly strongly.&nbsp; I beg you to go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting
down</i>.]&nbsp; Last night was excessively unfortunate.&nbsp;
That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I wanted to
kiss her.&nbsp; What harm is there in a kiss?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning
round</i>.]&nbsp; A kiss may ruin a human life, George
Harford.&nbsp; <i>I</i> know that.&nbsp; <i>I</i> know that too
well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; We
won&rsquo;t discuss that at present.&nbsp; What is of importance
to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.&nbsp; I am extremely fond
of him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired
his conduct last night immensely.&nbsp; He took up the cudgels
for that pretty prude with wonderful promptitude.&nbsp; He is
just what I should have liked a son of mine to be.&nbsp; Except
that no son of mine should ever take the side of the Puritans:
that is always an error.&nbsp; Now, what I propose is this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Lord
Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; According
to our ridiculous English laws, I can&rsquo;t legitimise
Gerald.&nbsp; But I can leave him my property.&nbsp; Illingworth
is entailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a
place.&nbsp; He can have Ashby, which is much prettier,
Harborough, which has the best shooting in the north of England,
and the house in St. James Square.&nbsp; What more can a
gentleman require in this world?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Nothing more,
I am quite sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; As for a
title, a title is really rather a nuisance in these democratic
days.&nbsp; As George Harford I had everything I wanted.&nbsp;
Now I have merely everything that other people want, which
isn&rsquo;t nearly so pleasant.&nbsp; Well, my proposal is
this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I told you I
was not interested, and I beg you to go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; The boy is
to be with you for six months in the year, and with me for the
other six.&nbsp; That is perfectly fair, is it not?&nbsp; You can
have whatever allowance you like, and live where you
choose.&nbsp; As for your past, no one knows anything about it
except myself and Gerald.&nbsp; There is the Puritan, of course,
the Puritan in white muslin, but she doesn&rsquo;t count.&nbsp;
She couldn&rsquo;t tell the story without explaining that she
objected to being kissed, could she?&nbsp; And all the women
would think her a fool and the men think her a bore.&nbsp; And
you need not be afraid that Gerald won&rsquo;t be my heir.&nbsp;
I needn&rsquo;t tell you I have not the slightest intention of
marrying.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; You come too
late.&nbsp; My son has no need of you.&nbsp; You are not
necessary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; What do you
mean, Rachel?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; That you are
not necessary to Gerald&rsquo;s career.&nbsp; He does not require
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I do not
understand you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Look into the
garden.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>
<i>rises and goes towards window</i>.]&nbsp; You had better not
let them see you: you bring unpleasant memories.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span> <i>looks out and
starts</i>.]&nbsp; She loves him.&nbsp; They love each
other.&nbsp; We are safe from you, and we are going away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Where?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; We will not
tell you, and if you find us we will not know you.&nbsp; You seem
surprised.&nbsp; What welcome would you get from the girl whose
lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed,
from the mother whose dishonour comes from you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; You have
grown hard, Rachel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I was too
weak once.&nbsp; It is well for me that I have changed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I was very
young at the time.&nbsp; We men know life too early.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; And we women
know life too late.&nbsp; That is the difference between men and
women.&nbsp; [<i>A pause</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Rachel, I
want my son.&nbsp; My money may be of no use to him now.&nbsp; I
may be of no use to him, but I want my son.&nbsp; Bring us
together, Rachel.&nbsp; You can do it if you choose.&nbsp;
[<i>Sees letter on table</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; There is no
room in my boy&rsquo;s life for you.&nbsp; He is not interested
in <i>you</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Then why
does he write to me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; What do you
mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; What letter
is this?&nbsp; [<i>Takes up letter</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; That&mdash;is
nothing.&nbsp; Give it to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; It is
addressed to <i>me</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; You are not
to open it.&nbsp; I forbid you to open it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; And in
Gerald&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; It was not to
have been sent.&nbsp; It is a letter he wrote to you this
morning, before he saw me.&nbsp; But he is sorry now he wrote it,
very sorry.&nbsp; You are not to open it.&nbsp; Give it to
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; It belongs
to me.&nbsp; [<i>Opens it</i>, <i>sits down and reads it
slowly</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span> <i>watches
him all the time</i>.]&nbsp; You have read this letter, I
suppose, Rachel?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; No.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; You know
what is in it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Yes!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t admit for a moment that the boy is right in what he
says.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t admit that it is any duty of mine to
marry you.&nbsp; I deny it entirely.&nbsp; But to get my son back
I am ready&mdash;yes, I am ready to marry you, Rachel&mdash;and
to treat you always with the deference and respect due to my
wife.&nbsp; I will marry you as soon as you choose.&nbsp; I give
you my word of honour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; You made that
promise to me once before and broke it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I will keep
it now.&nbsp; And that will show you that I love my son, at least
as much as you love him.&nbsp; For when I marry you, Rachel,
there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.&nbsp; High
ambitions, too, if any ambition is high.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I decline to
marry you, Lord Illingworth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Are you
serious?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Do tell me
your reasons.&nbsp; They would interest me enormously.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; I have
already explained them to my son.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I suppose
they were intensely sentimental, weren&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; You
women live by your emotions and for them.&nbsp; You have no
philosophy of life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; You are
right.&nbsp; We women live by our emotions and for them.&nbsp; By
our passions, and for them, if you will.&nbsp; I have two
passions, Lord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you.&nbsp;
You cannot kill those.&nbsp; They feed each other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; What sort
of love is that which needs to have hate as its brother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; It is the
sort of love I have for Gerald.&nbsp; Do you think that
terrible?&nbsp; Well it is terrible.&nbsp; All love is
terrible.&nbsp; All love is a tragedy.&nbsp; I loved you once,
Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; Oh, what a tragedy for a woman to have
loved you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; So you
really refuse to marry me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; Because you
hate me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; And does my
son hate me as you do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; No.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; I am glad
of that, Rachel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; He merely
despises you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; What a
pity!&nbsp; What a pity for him, I mean.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
be deceived, George.&nbsp; Children begin by loving their
parents.&nbsp; After a time they judge them.&nbsp; Rarely if ever
do they forgive them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Reads
letter over again</i>, <i>very slowly</i>.]&nbsp; May I ask by
what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, this
beautiful, passionate letter, believe that you should not marry
his father, the father of your own child?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; It was not I
who made him see it.&nbsp; It was another.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; What
<i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> person?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; The Puritan,
Lord Illingworth.&nbsp; [<i>A pause</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Winces</i>, <i>then rises slowly and goes over to table where
his hat and gloves are</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Arbuthnot</span> <i>is standing close to the table</i>.&nbsp;
<i>He picks up one of the gloves, and begins pulling it
on</i>.]&nbsp; There is not much then for me to do here,
Rachel?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; Nothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; It is
good-bye, is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Arbuthnot</span>.&nbsp; For ever, I
hope, this time, Lord Illingworth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Illingworth</span>.&nbsp; How
curious!&nbsp; At this moment you look exactly as you looked the
night you left me twenty years ago.&nbsp; You have just the same
expression in your mouth.&nbsp; Upon my word, Rachel, no woman
ever loved me as you did.&nbsp; Why, you gave yourself to me like
a flower, to do anything I liked with.&nbsp; You were the
prettiest of playthings, the most fascinating of small romances .
. . [<i>Pulls out watch</i>.]&nbsp; Quarter to two!&nbsp; Must be
strolling back to Hunstanton.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t suppose I shall
see you there again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry, I am, really.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s been an amusing experience to have met amongst people
of one&rsquo;s own rank, and treated quite seriously too,
one&rsquo;s mistress, and one&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
